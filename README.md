PYrus is a prank virus built on python. It does not harm the computer in any way. Python is necessary to run the program. It only runs on **Windows** since it is showing the _Blue Screen of Death_ and dependencies won't work on other operating systems.

> Disclaimer: This is not an _actual_ virus. It shows only pictures and plays sounds to make it look scary. It won't be responsible for any _real_ computer viruses affected your computer in any way.

## Setup
* You need to install any Python version. You can follow [this](https://www.python.org/downloads/) link to download Python.
* Then you need to install PyAutoGui and Pillow packages from pip. To do that, execute the following command:
```bash
$ pip install pyautogui Pillow
```
* Program is pretty much ready. You can follow the [Usage](#usage) guide to know how to use it.

## Usage
* After you set the program up, you can start the _start.bat_ file in order to activate prank.
* Script will wait 5 seconds to allow you to close the folder you have opened it from.
* You don't have to close any open program or folder other than the one you started it, script will automatically go to the desktop after 5 seconds and take a screenshot.
* AutoHotKey script will be executed to maximize the sound of the computer.
* Desktop will freeze after the screenshot, script will activate when anyone clicks anywhere on the screen.
* After 1 second of the click, you will see the Blue Screen of Death. It will go from 0% to 20% and 35%. 
* When passing the 35%, you will see that BSOD will start to change colours and you will hear some sound effects.
* After a few seconds, everything will go crazy. Meanwhile, ```ALT+F4``` and ```ESC``` buttons and/or combinations won't work.
* Even though you manage to open the Task Manager, if it is not set to be _Always On Top_, you will not be able to close it.
* After 4 times of loop on final screen, script will terminate itself.

## Warnings
* It is not a real virus.
* It is terrifying if you are not expecting it.
* Be careful not to unplug the computer (or force shutdown with holding the power button down) since it is going to be harmful for your computer.
* You can mute the sound after you start the script. In most cases, it won't trigger the script to initiate.
* If you have time, you can test it on your computer to make sure it runs perfectly. If it doesn't and you are getting errors, please report them on [Issues](https://github.com/yagiziskirik/PYrus/issues) section.
* Have fun.
* And most important, please record the person that you are pranking. It is hilarious to watch.
